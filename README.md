# spacewar
A two-player, Java applet version of the old PDP-10 game Spacewar!

At some point I decided to learn Java. This was something I did to keep my interest. It's a two-player game, but both players have to be on the same computer, using different parts of the keyboard, so it's not networked in any way. That was how the original MS-DOS game that inspired it worked, before networking was a thing. Eventually I fell in love with Node.js and ported the game to that, so you can see my other project, spacewarjs, which is in fact networked, at least up to two-players.
